[00:44] empathetic and for the way that you
[00:46] elevate the craft we're indebted to

[00:58] their commitment to a role just just as
[01:00] Daniel D Lewis stayed in character as
[01:02] Lincoln this past year Paul Giamatti was
[01:05] so committed that for the character to
[01:07] have a lazy eye he wore a soft contact
[01:10] lens during the entire shoot which made
[01:13] him blind in that eye while
[01:15] filming would I have done that hell yes
