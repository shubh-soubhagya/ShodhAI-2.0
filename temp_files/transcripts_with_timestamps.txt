[02:04] wow oh my

[02:10] um I think any of us who make movies
[02:14] know that you kind of dream of this
[02:16] moment you know you do right I could
[02:20] deny it but I have been dreaming about
[02:22] this moment for so long um but it seemed
[02:25] so unlikely that it would ever actually
[02:27] happen and now I'm standing here and
[02:29] everything's kind of gone out of my head
[02:31] um the the reason this movie was the
[02:36] movie that it was was Chris noan um he
[02:39] is
[02:41] singular he is brilliant and um I'm so
[02:46] grateful to you um
[02:49] but as Emma said this is the thing
[02:51] that's fantastic about our jobs is that
[02:53] it's about collaboration it's about
[02:54] teamwork and our team was just
[02:57] incredible on this movie so thank you to
[02:59] all of them both cast and crew thank you

[03:06] I want to
[03:07] thank Rich gond at IMX um and everybody

[03:16] much sense to do so um thank you to all
