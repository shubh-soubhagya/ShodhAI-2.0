[00:00] um I don't suppose any of you have ever
[00:02] noticed that traditionally the Best
[00:05] Picture award is presented
[00:09] solo probably because they want some guy
[00:11] like me messing around making comments
[00:14] about sequence chiffon Rouge
[00:22] ringlets however tonight it is my great
[00:24] pleasure to introduce live from the

[00:44] White House everyone I am so honored to
[00:47] help introduce this year's nominees for
[00:49] Best Picture and to help celebrate the
[00:52] movies that lift our Spirits broaden our
[00:55] minds and transport us to places we have
[00:58] never imagined this has been an exciting
[01:01] year for movies and I want to
[01:03] congratulate all the nominees on their
[01:05] tremendous work these Nine Movies took
[01:08] us back in time and all around the world
[01:12] they made us laugh they made us weep and
[01:14] they made us grip our arm rest just a
[01:16] little tighter they taught us that love
[01:19] can endure Against All Odds and
[01:22] transform our lives in the most
[01:24] surprising ways and they reminded us
[01:27] that we can overcome any obstacle if we
[01:29] we dig deep enough and fight hard enough
[01:33] and find the courage to believe in
[01:35] ourselves these lessons apply to all of
[01:38] us no matter who we are or what we look
[01:40] like or where we come from or who we
[01:43] love but they are especially important
[01:45] for our young people every day through
[01:48] engagement in the Arts our children
[01:51] learn to open their imaginations to
[01:53] dream just a little bigger and to strive
[01:56] every day to reach those dreams and I
[01:59] want to thank all of you here tonight
