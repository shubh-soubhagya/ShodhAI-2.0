[00:19] Hear that?
[00:21] That's nothing.
[00:24] Which is what I, as a speaker
at today's conference,
[00:28] have for you all.
[00:30] I have nothing.
[00:32] Nada.
[00:33] Zip.
[00:34] Zilch.
[00:36] Zippo.
[00:37] Nothing smart. Nothing inspirational.
[00:40] Nothing even remotely researched at all.
[00:43] I have absolutely
nothing to say whatsoever.
[00:47] And yet, through my manner of speaking,
I will make it seem like I do.
[00:53] Like what I am saying is brilliant.
[00:55] And maybe, just maybe, you will feel
like you've learned something.
[01:02] Now, I'm going to get started
with the opening.
[01:04] I'm going to make 
a lot of hand gestures.
[01:06] I'm going to do this with my right hand,
I'm going to do this with my left.
[01:10] I'm going to adjust my glasses.
[01:11] And then I'm going to ask you all
a question.
[01:13] By a show of hands, how many of you all
have been asked a question before?
[01:17] (Laughter)
[01:18] Okay, great, I'm seeing some hands.
[01:20] And again, I have nothing here.
[01:23] Now, I'm gonna react to that
[01:24] and act like I'm telling you
a personal anecdote.
[01:27] Something to break the tension.
[01:30] Something to endear myself a little bit.
[01:32] Something kind of embarrassing.
[01:38] And you guys 
are going to make an "aw" sound.
[01:41] It's true. It really happened.
[01:44] (Laughter)
[01:45] And now I'm going to bring it
to a broader point.
[01:47] I'm going to really beckon.
[01:50] I'm going to make it intellectual.
[01:52] I'm going to bring it to this man
right here.
[01:55] Now, what this man did
was important, I'm sure.
[01:59] (Laughter)
[02:01] But I, for one,
have no idea who he is.
[02:04] I simply googled image
the word "Scientist."
[02:07] (Laughter)
[02:08] And now you see, I'd like it to seem
like I'm making points,
[02:11] building an argument,
[02:13] inspiring you to change your life,
when in reality,
[02:16] this is just
[02:17] me...
[02:19] buying...
[02:20] time...
[02:20] Now, if you don't believe me,
let's take a look at the numbers.
[02:23] This is a real thing
that's happening right now.
[02:26] The number of talks
that I'm giving is one.
[02:30] Interesting facts imparted
thus far in said talk,
[02:32] well, that's going to be a zero.
[02:34] My height in inches is 70.5.
Note the .5 there.
[02:39] 2x6 equals 12.
[02:41] And then interestingly enough
6x2 also equals 12.
[02:43] That's math.
[02:46] 352 is a three-digit number
[02:50] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and then almost immediately
following that we get 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[02:56] Now, to add more filler here,
[02:57] I'm going to give you
a couple more number to consider,
[03:00] uh ... 18.
[03:02] 237.
[03:03] 5,601.
[03:06] 2.6 million.
[03:08] Four.
[03:10] Four.
[03:11] 24. Staggering!
[03:14] (Laughter)
[03:15] These are real numbers, all of them.
[03:17] And to follow that up,
let's take a look at some graphs.
[03:20] Now, if you take a look at this pie chart,
what you're going to see
[03:23] is that the majority
far exceeds the minority.
[03:26] Everybody see that? Cool, isn't it?
[03:29] And let's take a look at this bar graph,
[03:31] 'cause it shows similarly irrelevant data.
[03:34] Now, I'm doing this because
I'd like to make it seem
[03:37] like I've done my homework.
[03:39] If you were, say, watching this
on YouTube with the sound off,
[03:42] you might think, "Ah, okay.
This guy knows what he's talking about."
[03:47] But I don't.
[03:48] I'm floundering, panicking.
I've got nothing.
[03:51] I'm a total and utter phony.
[03:53] But you know what?
[03:55] I was offered a TED Talk.
[03:57] And dammit, I'm gonna see it through.
[03:59] (Laughter)
[04:01] Now, if you take a look behind me,
[04:03] these are just words paired with
vaguely thought-provoking stock photos.
[04:08] I'm going to point at them
[04:09] like I'm making use
both of my time as well as your time.
[04:12] But in reality, I don't know
what half of them mean.
[04:15] And now, as these continue,
I'm just going to start saying gibberish.
[04:19] Wagga wah, gabba gabba.
[04:21] Turkey, mouth and a mouth.
[04:24] Chip, trip, my dog Skip.
[04:27] Rip it and dip it, Richard.
[04:29] I'm an itty-bitty baby bopper.
[04:31] And I'm hungry in my tum tum.
[04:33] Brad Pitt, Uma Thurman.
[04:36] Names, things.
[04:37] Words, words and more things.
[04:39] And see? It feels like it might
make sense, doesn't it?
[04:43] Like maybe, just maybe,
[04:44] I'm building to some sort of
satisfying conclusion,
[04:47] I mean, I'm gesticulating as though I am.
[04:49] I'm pacing, I'm growing in intensity,
[04:51] I'm taking off my glasses,
which by the way, are just frames.
[04:54] (Laughter)
[04:59] I wore them to look smart,
[05:02] even though my vision is perfect.
[05:07] And now I'm going to slow things down
a little bit.
[05:10] I'm going to change the tone.
[05:13] I'm going to make it seem
like I'm building to a moment.
[05:20] And what if I was?
[05:22] (Laughter)
[05:24] Amazing, isn't it? What can we do?
[05:26] Life's a roller coaster.
[05:32] You know, if there's one thing
you'd take away from my talk,
[05:35] I'd like you to think about
what you heard at the beginning,
[05:38] and I'd like you to think
about what you hear now.
[05:42] Because it was nothing
[05:44] and it's still nothing, think about that.
[05:47] Or don't, that's fine.
[05:49] And now I'm going to stop talking.
[05:52] Thank you.
[05:53] (Applause)
