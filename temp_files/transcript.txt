um I don't suppose any of you have ever noticed that traditionally the Best Picture award is presented solo probably because they want some guy like me messing around making comments about sequence chiffon Rouge ringlets however tonight it is my great pleasure to introduce live from the White House the first lady of the United States Michelle Obama thank you Jack and welcome to the White House everyone I am so honored to help introduce this year's nominees for Best Picture and to help celebrate the movies that lift our Spirits broaden our minds and transport us to places we have never imagined this has been an exciting year for movies and I want to congratulate all the nominees on their tremendous work these Nine Movies took us back in time and all around the world they made us laugh they made us weep and they made us grip our arm rest just a little tighter they taught us that love can endure Against All Odds and transform our lives in the most surprising ways and they reminded us that we can overcome any obstacle if we we dig deep enough and fight hard enough and find the courage to believe in ourselves these lessons apply to all of us no matter who we are or what we look like or where we come from or who we love but they are especially important for our young people every day through engagement in the Arts our children learn to open their imaginations to dream just a little bigger and to strive every day to reach those dreams and I want to thank all of you here tonight for being part of that vitally important work and now I'm going to turn it back over to you jack to give us the nominees well nobody's going to mess around with that are they think so well let's recap the outstanding nine nominees for tonight's best picture [Music] Amore Argo Beasts of
