PM Narendra Modi To Chair Key Cabinet Panel Meet Today. Why It Is Significant
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will chair a crucial meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs or CCPA -- the most important committee of the cabinet that has also been dubbed the "Super Cabinet".
The meet comes after a round of meetings of the Cabinet Committee of Security - the next one is due today - following last week's terror attack in Kashmir's Pahalgam.
After the first round of the CCS meeting, the government had announced a series of non-military measures against Pakistan, including a freeze on the Indus Waters Treaty, shutting of the Attari border and cancellation of visas.
The CCPA
had met last after the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama in 2019 to review the security situation and formulate counter-strategies. The meet had signed off on the withdrawal of the Most Favoured Nation status given to Pakistan. Later, on February 26, 2019, the Indian Air Force carried out the airstrike on terror camps in Balakot.

Hashim Moosa, Pahalgam Killer On The Run, Is Former Pak Commando: Sources
Security agencies have identified three terrorists involved in plotting the Pahalgam terror attack in which 25 tourists and a Kashmiri pony ride operator were shot dead in cold blood. Two of them -- Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafeez Saeed and his deputy Saifullah Kasuri -- are in Pakistan, and the third, Hashim Moosa, is believed to be hiding in Jammu and Kashmir.
Sources in the security establishment have said Hashim Moosa is hiding somewhere in the forests of south Kashmir and an all-out operation has been launched to track him down. The terrorist, security agencies fear, will try to flee to Pakistan. Jammu and Kashmir police have announced a bounty of Rs 20 lakh for any information about Hashim Musa and assured that the informer's identity will be kept secret.

More than 30 people have been arrested in Assam so far for controversial social media posts about the Pahalgam terror attack, which killed 26 civilians.
Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the arrests were made for supporting Pakistan on social media. He also warned that those with greater involvement or a prior history would be booked under the National Security Act (NSA).
"There are no similarities between Bharat and Pakistan. The two countries are enemy nations, and we must remain so," Mr Sarma stated while speaking with the media on Tuesday.
