Srinagar:
The Jammu and Kashmir government has shut dozens of resorts and more than half of the tourist destinations in the Union territory. The preventive move came amid security concerns, days after a terror attack at the scenic meadows of Pahalgam left 26 civilians dead.At least 48 resorts have been shut in the Union territory known for its serene valleys and picturesque mountains. Several tourist sites like Doodhpatri in Budgam and Verinag in Anantnag have also been made out of bounds to tourists.The decision comes amid uncertainty over Kashmir tourism, a major source of income for the locals. Scared after the massacre, tourists have been fleeing the Union territory, while many travellers have cancelled their upcoming tours.Follow updates hereJust a week ago, Pahalgam town had a bustling market dotted with tourists. But now the tourist figures have dropped significantly.Locals fear the drop in tourism will have a big impact on their source of income and livelihoods as the town is yet to come to terms with last week's horror. They have also staged protests condemning the terror attack, asserting their solidarity with the victims.Calling for decisive action against terrorism, Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has said that the people of Kashmir have come out openly against the murder of innocent people, and one must avoid any misplaced action that alienates people.In a powerful speech at a special assembly session yesterday, he said this is the first time in over two decades that the people of Jammu and Kashmir have come out on the streets in such huge numbers to protest against a terror attack."From Kathua to Kupwara, there is no town or village where people did not protest against this. They said, 'Not in my name'. And this is spontaneous," he said, adding that he has no words to apologise to the victims.He also refused to use this tragedy to press his statehood demand, saying his politics is not "cheap".Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, has vowed to punish the terrorists and their backers, saying that Indian troops would pursue them to the ends of the earth.
