Razorpay, the payment service provider, has launched the first MCP server to enhance the connectivity between the business’ AI assistant and the payment gateway. Razorpay is the first payment gateway to assimilate the Model Context Protocol Server (MCP).
The MCP server will allow businesses to connect their AI agent/assistant directly to Razorpay’s infrastructure. This new MCP server will reduce the AI agent integration time to just 15 minutes, reducing the waiting period by months.
Payment automation by Razorpay-
Instead of going to the Dashboard of Razorpay, businesses can not simply give the prompts to their AI agents like Zapier and Claude, who will automatically take care of tasks like payment management and payment link generation.

Razorpay’s latest MCP server primarily aims to streamline administrative work and workflow automation. Instead of going on the dashboard and filing multiple forms for multiple subjects for different types of processes like payment, collection and refund, the business can now simply plug in their AI to perform these tasks instead.
Khilan Haria, Chief Product Officer at Razorpay, says that payments can now be embedded seamlessly within any AI system, a conversation, an app, or even a fully autonomous workflow, happening intuitively in the background, without clicks, redirects, or waiting.
“This small but significant launch carries massive future implications: seamless multi-provider connections, simplified payment flows across diverse systems, enhanced security with standardised protocols, and a foundation ready to power the next wave of innovations. It opens the door to intelligent, frictionless financial experiences where businesses no longer have to adapt to payments, payments adapt to them.”, Haria says in a statement.
What Next-
Razorpay’s new MCP server also opens the doors for future possibilities like voice-activated payments and one-tap onboarding of customers for the companies.
Meanwhile, the company is in the process of shifting its headquarters from the United States to India. The company has also converted to a public entity. The fintech unicorn is planning for an IPO in the next two years.
